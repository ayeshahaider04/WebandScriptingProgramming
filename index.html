                <img src="images/student-photo.jpg" alt="Ayesha Haider" class="profile-pic">
                <p>I’m currently in my 3rd year in the Networking and IT Security program at Ontario Tech University. So far, I have learned many things relating to computer networks and hope to keep expanding my knowledge on the subject. I’ve acquired some of my experience through some of the projects I have worked on during my time in school, in which I aided in the creation of various network topologies. Configuring them, implementing security measures, and more. My most recent projects consisted of a small network topology of the devices associated with the school's campuses through the use of switching protocols like spanning tree. As well as utilising routing protocols such as BGP, EIGRP, and OSPFin another network design project. I’m always wanting to strengthen my skills and learn more about networking and I'm looking forward to using this website as my own personal portfolio to track my progress.
